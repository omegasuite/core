// BlockLocator is used to help locate a specific block.  The algorithm for

// to a reasonable number of entries, first the most recent previous 12 block
// hashes are added, then the step is doubled each loop iteration to
// exponentially decrease the number of hashes as a function of the distance
// from the block being located.
//
// For example, assume a block chain with a side chain as depicted below:
// 	genesis -> 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 15 -> 16  -> 17  -> 18
// 	                              \-> 16a -> 17a

// The block locator for block 17a would be the hashes of blocks:
// [17a 16a 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 4 genesis]
